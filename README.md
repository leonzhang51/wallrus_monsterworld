Ref:
Test REACT

Using the Invision project shared with you in the link below we would like you to create a REACT project targeting the latest iOS Safari mobile browser and integrate the 3 views you will find there.

We would like to use the document provided in INVISION to do the integration.

We will provide you with a GItlab repository, you must use the Gitlab to commit your work providing a brief explanation on how to run the project it using a proper README file.

I will need your Gitlab user name please send it to me as soon as you can.

Requirements:

Navigate among the 3 views
Clicking on ‘ABOUT THE MONSTER WORLD’ links to ‘THE STORY’ view

            Clicking on the ‘START EXPERIENCE’ links to ‘NAME & HEIGHT FORM’ VIEW.

We would you like to use REACTS hooks

We expect the fields YOUR FIRST NAME AND HEIGHT to be validated.
The NEXT button links back to the ‘HOME PAGE’

INVISION

https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/21960267

App directory structure

There are 3 components in this app, Home, The story, Name and height, I put them in src/components, all the component can work alone, I don't use any global css or other resource, every component using its own css module. All the relative img file stored in public/img.

External resource : react router v6,
Fonts: Imperator and Circular Air import from db.onlinewebfonts.com.

Usage:
Download the file then extract to the folder you assigned,
Enter the folder, execute

npm start

Enjoy!!!!!!
